// Note that the PrimaryColor and SecondaryColor types arenâ€™t listed on the front page (cargo doc), 
// nor is the mix function. We have to click kinds and utils to see them.

// In order to publish one need an api key from crates.io.
// To do this, we need to create an account on crates.io and then run the following command in the terminal:
// $ cargo login
// abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345 (<- api key)
// This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in ~/.cargo/credentials

// To publish the crate, we need to make sure that the version number in Cargo.toml is updated.
// along with a unique name for the crate, a description, and a license type.
// We can also add a README.md file to provide more information about the crate and its usage.
// once we have the API key, we can publish the crate using the following command:
// $ cargo publish --dry-run    // (to check if everything is ok)
// $ cargo publish             // (to publish the crate)

// To republish a crate, we need to update the version number in Cargo.toml to a new version number.
// Then just run the cargo publish command again.
// See https://semver.org/ for versioning guidelines.

// Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while allowing all existing projects 
// that depend on it to continue. Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break, 
// and any future Cargo.lock files generated will not use the yanked version.

// $ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
// $ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
