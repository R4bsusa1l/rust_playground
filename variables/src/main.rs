// Variables and Mutability
// Variables are immutable by default in Rust. To make a variable mutable, we use the `mut` keyword.
// This means that we can change the value of a variable after it has been declared.
// However, we cannot change the type of a variable after it has been declared.
// For example, we can change the value of a mutable variable, but we cannot change the type of a variable.
// In Rust, we can also shadow a variable by declaring a new variable with the same name.
// This means that we can create a new variable with the same name as an existing variable, and the new variable will shadow the old variable.
// This is useful when we want to change the value of a variable, but we don't want to change the type of the variable.
// In this example, we will create a mutable variable, change its value, and then shadow it with a new variable.
// We will also create a new variable with the same name as an existing variable, and then shadow it with a new variable.
